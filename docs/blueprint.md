## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Indigo (#4F46E5) for a sense of focus and oversight, avoiding bright/electric blues which would cause fatigue during long sessions monitoring a dashboard.
- Background color: Very dark gray (#1E1B2B) for comfortable, high-contrast, low-fatigue viewing conditions in a monitoring context.
- Accent color: Teal (#3B82F6) to highlight key data points and actions, giving it a cool crisp look while keeping a lower contrast ratio and avoiding a loud aesthetic.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' sans-serif for a modern and neutral feel that can easily allow viewing large walls of brief text
- Code font: 'Source Code Pro' for any displayed code snippets or log lines, ensuring legibility.
- Use of semantic emoji within logs to visually categorize and prioritize information, and line icons from a consistent set for UI elements.
- Dashboard layout with clear sections for real-time logs, project roadmap, and idea submission, utilizing a grid system for responsiveness.
- Subtle animations to highlight updates in real-time logs or task status changes, providing a non-intrusive visual cue.
